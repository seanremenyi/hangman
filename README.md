# hangman
Basic game of hangman to be enjoyed on the terminal

Starting out with programming, I am starting with a few games as projects. This will be your run-of-the-mill game of hangman.
I created an array of words and the game will pick a random one from the list. This way you can play on your own without knowing the answer.
I added some my own ascii art to display to the terminal. Be kind (I'm no artist).
